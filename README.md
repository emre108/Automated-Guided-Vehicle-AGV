# Automated-Guided-Vehicle-AGV-

In this project, we design an AGV that can track the line on the surface, sense the colored plane, avoid collisions, communicate with other stations, and identify the loads. Operators can call the AGV to get the load anytime from the stations located in the production line. With the help of lines and edges on the surface, AGV can find the right way. The AGV can see the obstacles on its way. It firstly slows down and then stops at a safe distance. The AGV warns workers around them with audible and light warning systems and can operate safely in the same environment as humans. Thanks to wireless modules it can be controlled by long distances and can be seen what AGV sees while working. It can be controlled by authorized personal with smartphones and also can be employed to go to stations manually. With the help of the vision module(myRio+camera), it can identify what kind of load it is going to carry. There is a lifting unit above the car that we call an elevator. According to the load type, the lifting unit can be activated. The AGV sense where the lifting areas are, and when to start lifting.
